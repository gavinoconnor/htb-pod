          Is it your time to Spill the Whine? Got a juicy story you’ve never shared with anyone? No time like the present. All the stories you’ve heard on our podcast have been submitted by listeners LIKE YOU.  We want to hear it all. A harrowing birth story? A comically ill-timed blowout? Debilitating postpartum anxiety? From small to the extremely big - we are here to be vulnerable and share the things that no one talks about. We are creating space for the good, the bad, and the exceptionally hideous. Join us.

          You can record yourself telling a story right from your phone! Then email us the audio file and any corresponding photos you would like to be featured on our <a href='https://www.instagram.com/hittingthebottle/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">@<u>hittingthebottle</u></a> Instagram page.

          It must be said - we appreciate you all very much.  Creating this community and providing space for your stories is a dream for us.  We cannot wait to see what we can build and hope you’ll stick by our side through all the tears, laughter, and inevitable cocktail-fueled sidebars.
